Documented Milestone 3 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on setting up a solid backend infrastructure to support the applicationâ€™s growth and data management.

**Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller ðŸš€**

In Milestone 4, we expanded our backend by introducing User Models, Controllers, and File Uploads.

âœ… User Model Implementation
Defined a User Schema using Mongoose to store user details (name, email, password, etc.).
Implemented necessary validations to ensure data integrity.
Integrated bcrypt for secure password hashing.

âœ… User Controller Setup
Developed controller functions to:
Create new users
Retrieve user details
Update user information
Delete users if necessary

Updated the README with Milestone 4 details.
This milestone strengthened the user management aspect of our application, making it more robust and scalable for future enhancements.

**Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page ðŸš€**

In Milestone 5, we focused on building the frontend Sign-Up page and implementing client-side form validation.

âœ… Sign-Up Page UI Development
Created the user interface for the Sign-Up page using HTML and CSS (likely with Tailwind CSS).
Included fields for name, email, and password.
Designed the page to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

âœ… Form Validation
Implemented client-side form validation to ensure data quality.
Validated email format, password strength (e.g., minimum length), and other necessary fields.
Provided user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

âœ… README Update
Documented Milestone 5 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on creating the user registration interface and ensuring that the data entered by the user is valid before being sent to the backend. This improves user experience and reduces the load on the server.

**Milestone 6: Backend Signup Endpoint and Password Encryption ðŸš€**
In Milestone 6, we implemented the backend endpoint to handle user signup and securely store user data, including encrypting passwords.

âœ… Signup Endpoint Implementation
Created a new route and controller function to handle POST requests to the signup endpoint.
Received user data from the frontend signup form.

âœ… Password Encryption
Used bcrypt to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
Ensured that passwords are never stored in plain text.

âœ… User Data Storage
Stored the complete user data (name, email, hashed password, etc.) in the MongoDB database.
Implemented error handling for duplicate entries and other potential issues.

âœ… README Update
Documented Milestone 6 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on securely handling user registration on the backend, including the crucial step of password encryption. This is essential for protecting user data and maintaining security best practices.
