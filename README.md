# Ecommerce_Follow_Along


E-Commerce Follow Along: Key Takeaways Project Goals Build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Gain hands-on experience in real-world full-stack development.

Learning Outcomes Understand the structure of a MERN stack project. Set up project repositories and foundational tools. Master core functionalities: User authentication. Product and order management. Database schema design. Core Concepts REST API Design: Create endpoints for users, products, and orders. MongoDB Schema: Design meaningful and structured data models. Authentication: Implement secure login and registration systems. Backend Development: Use Node.js and Express for robust server-side APIs.

Milestones Overview

Project Overview Introduction to the MERN stack. Live demo of the final e-commerce application. Set up a GitHub repository with a README summarizing Milestone 1.
Development Environment Setup Install tools: Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and VS Code. Initialize the project with npm init and install dependencies (e.g., express, mongoose, dotenv).
Backend Development Create REST APIs for: User Authentication (Register/Login). Product Management (Add, update, delete, and retrieve products). Order Handling (Manage orders and transactions). Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders. Implement middleware for validation and error handling.
Frontend Development Set up the React project with create-react-app or Vite. Build key UI components: User Pages (Login, Registration, Profile). Product Pages (Listing, Search, Details). Order Pages (Cart, Checkout, Order History). Use React Router for navigation and manage state with Redux or Context API.
Integration, Testing, and Deployment Integrate the frontend and backend using API calls. Test functionality and resolve bugs with tools like Postman.
Deploy: Backend using Heroku, Render, or AWS. Frontend using Netlify or Vercel. Ensure the application is secure and production-ready. Final Deliverable A complete MERN-based e-commerce application featuring: Secure authentication. Product and order management. A responsive and user-friendly interface. Fully tested and deployed online.






# Milestone 2: Project Structure & Login Page üöÄ  

## Overview  
In Milestone 2, we focused on structuring the project, setting up both the frontend and backend, and developing the Login Page for the e-commerce application.

- Implemented a fully functional and styled **Login Page**.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Setup  
- Set up a basic **Node.js + Express** server to prepare for future API integration.  

### üéØ Learning Outcomes  
By completing this milestone, we learned:  
- How to structure a full-stack project.  
- Setting up a React application with Tailwind CSS.  
- Configuring a Node.js backend.  
- Creating a login page with basic styling and functionality.  

## ‚úÖ Submission Details  
- Code is pushed to the **GitHub repository** created in Milestone 1.  
- The repository includes:  
  - **Proper folder structure** (frontend & backend).  
  - **Functional Login Page**.  
  - **Updated README** summarizing the progress.  







# Milestone 4 - User Model, Controllers & File Uploads

## Introduction üöÄ
Welcome to Milestone 4! In this milestone, we will focus on enhancing our backend by implementing a User Model, setting up controllers to handle user-related data, and enabling file uploads using Multer. By the end of this milestone, you will have a structured way to store user data, manage interactions, and support file uploads.

---

## Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:
- **Create a User Model**: Define the structure of user data in the database.
- **Create a User Controller**: Manage user-related operations such as adding and retrieving user information.
- **Enable and Configure Multer**: Implement file uploads to store user profile pictures or other files.
- **Update the README file**: Document your progress effectively.

---

## Key Concepts üìå
### 1. What‚Äôs a Model?
A **model** is like a blueprint that defines how data is stored in the database. In MongoDB, we use **Schemas** to structure our data.

- Example: A **User Model** may include fields like `name`, `email`, and `password`.
- This ensures consistency in how data is saved and retrieved.

### 2. What‚Äôs a Controller?
A **controller** is responsible for handling user interactions with the application. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.

- Example: When a user signs up, the controller handles the request, processes the data, and saves it to the database.
- Think of it as a **manager** that directs requests and responses efficiently.

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Multer is a middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.

- It enables users to upload profile pictures or other documents.
- It stores files in a designated folder and provides access to them when needed.

## Steps to Complete Milestone 4 üìù
This milestone includes the following steps:

1. **Create the User Model**
   - Define a schema for user data using Mongoose.
   - Ensure fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `profilePicture` are included.

2. **Create the User Controller**
   - Implement functions to handle user-related actions such as registering a user and retrieving user data.

3. **Set Up Multer for File Uploads**
   - Configure Multer to allow users to upload files.
   - Store uploaded files in a designated folder.
   
4. **Update the README File**
   - Document the new changes made in this milestone.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use the new features.

---

## Submission Guidelines üì•
To complete this milestone, follow these submission steps:

‚úÖ Push your code to the same GitHub repository used for previous milestones.
‚úÖ Ensure your repository is **publicly accessible**.
‚úÖ Update your **README file** with a section summarizing Milestone 4.
‚úÖ Submit your repository link as per the assignment requirements.
