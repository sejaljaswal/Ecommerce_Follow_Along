# Ecommerce_Follow_Along


E-Commerce Follow Along: Key Takeaways Project Goals Build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Gain hands-on experience in real-world full-stack development.

Learning Outcomes Understand the structure of a MERN stack project. Set up project repositories and foundational tools. Master core functionalities: User authentication. Product and order management. Database schema design. Core Concepts REST API Design: Create endpoints for users, products, and orders. MongoDB Schema: Design meaningful and structured data models. Authentication: Implement secure login and registration systems. Backend Development: Use Node.js and Express for robust server-side APIs.

Milestones Overview

Project Overview Introduction to the MERN stack. Live demo of the final e-commerce application. Set up a GitHub repository with a README summarizing Milestone 1.
Development Environment Setup Install tools: Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and VS Code. Initialize the project with npm init and install dependencies (e.g., express, mongoose, dotenv).
Backend Development Create REST APIs for: User Authentication (Register/Login). Product Management (Add, update, delete, and retrieve products). Order Handling (Manage orders and transactions). Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders. Implement middleware for validation and error handling.
Frontend Development Set up the React project with create-react-app or Vite. Build key UI components: User Pages (Login, Registration, Profile). Product Pages (Listing, Search, Details). Order Pages (Cart, Checkout, Order History). Use React Router for navigation and manage state with Redux or Context API.
Integration, Testing, and Deployment Integrate the frontend and backend using API calls. Test functionality and resolve bugs with tools like Postman.
Deploy: Backend using Heroku, Render, or AWS. Frontend using Netlify or Vercel. Ensure the application is secure and production-ready. Final Deliverable A complete MERN-based e-commerce application featuring: Secure authentication. Product and order management. A responsive and user-friendly interface. Fully tested and deployed online.





Milestone 2 Progress ðŸš€
âœ… Project Setup
Structured the project with separate frontend and backend directories.
Initialized a React app for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.
âœ… Tooling & Configuration
Configured Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive styling.
Added useful extensions to improve development efficiency.
âœ… Login Page Implementation
Designed and developed a fully functional Login Page.
Ensured proper UI styling using Tailwind CSS.
Set up basic authentication logic to handle user login.
This milestone laid the groundwork for the E-Commerce application by setting up the project structure and implementing the first user-facing feature.

Milestone 3 Progress ðŸš€
âœ… Backend Folder Structure
Organized backend code with separate folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
Introduced utils and middlewares directories for better modularity.
âœ… Server Setup
Created a backend server using Node.js and Express.
Configured the server to listen on a designated port.
âœ… Database Connection
Integrated MongoDB to store and manage data.
Verified successful connection between the server and MongoDB.
âœ… Error Handling
Implemented a global error handler for better debugging.
Provided meaningful error messages for invalid requests and failed operations.
âœ… README Update
Documented Milestone 3 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on setting up a solid backend infrastructure to support the applicationâ€™s growth and data management.

Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller ðŸš€
In Milestone 4, we expanded our backend by introducing User Models, Controllers, and File Uploads.

âœ… User Model Implementation
Defined a User Schema using Mongoose to store user details (name, email, password, etc.).
Implemented necessary validations to ensure data integrity.
Integrated bcrypt for secure password hashing.
âœ… User Controller Setup
Developed controller functions to:
Create new users
Retrieve user details
Update user information
Delete users if necessary
Handled error responses for invalid or duplicate user entries.
âœ… Multer File Upload Integration
Configured Multer to handle file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).
Implemented logic to store and retrieve uploaded images.
Ensured file validation to prevent invalid file types from being uploaded.
âœ… Project Submission
Pushed the updated code to GitHub.
Updated the README with Milestone 4 details.
This milestone strengthened the user management aspect of our application, making it more robust and scalable for future enhancements.

Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page ðŸš€
In Milestone 5, we focused on building the frontend Sign-Up page and implementing client-side form validation.

âœ… Sign-Up Page UI Development
Created the user interface for the Sign-Up page using HTML and CSS (likely with Tailwind CSS).
Included fields for name, email, and password.
Designed the page to be user-friendly and visually appealing.
âœ… Form Validation
Implemented client-side form validation to ensure data quality.
Validated email format, password strength (e.g., minimum length), and other necessary fields.
Provided user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
âœ… README Update
Documented Milestone 5 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on creating the user registration interface and ensuring that the data entered by the user is valid before being sent to the backend. This improves user experience and reduces the load on the server.

Milestone 6: Backend Signup Endpoint and Password Encryption ðŸš€
In Milestone 6, we implemented the backend endpoint to handle user signup and securely store user data, including encrypting passwords.

âœ… Signup Endpoint Implementation
Created a new route and controller function to handle POST requests to the signup endpoint.
Received user data from the frontend signup form.
âœ… Password Encryption
Used bcrypt to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
Ensured that passwords are never stored in plain text.
âœ… User Data Storage
Stored the complete user data (name, email, hashed password, etc.) in the MongoDB database.
Implemented error handling for duplicate entries and other potential issues.
âœ… README Update
Documented Milestone 6 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on securely handling user registration on the backend, including the crucial step of password encryption. This is essential for protecting user data and maintaining security best practices.
