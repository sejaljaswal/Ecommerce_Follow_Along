## Project Milestones

### **Milestone 2: Project Setup** ðŸš€

âœ… **Project Initialization**
- Structured the project with separate frontend and backend directories.
- Initialized a React app for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.

âœ… **Tooling & Configuration**
- Configured Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive styling.
- Added useful extensions to improve development efficiency.

âœ… **Login Page Implementation**
- Designed and developed a fully functional Login Page.
- Ensured proper UI styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Set up basic authentication logic to handle user login.

ðŸ“Œ *This milestone laid the groundwork for the E-Commerce application by setting up the project structure and implementing the first user-facing feature.*

### **Milestone 3: Backend Infrastructure Setup** ðŸš€

âœ… **Backend Folder Structure**
- Organized backend code with separate folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
- Introduced utils and middleware directories for better modularity.

âœ… **Server Setup**
- Created a backend server using Node.js and Express.
- Configured the server to listen on a designated port.

âœ… **Database Connection**
- Integrated MongoDB to store and manage data.
- Verified successful connection between the server and MongoDB.

âœ… **Error Handling**
- Implemented a global error handler for better debugging.
- Provided meaningful error messages for invalid requests and failed operations.

âœ… **README Update**
- Documented Milestone 3 progress in the README file.

ðŸ“Œ *This milestone focused on setting up a solid backend infrastructure to support the applicationâ€™s growth and data management.*

### **Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller** ðŸš€

âœ… **User Model Implementation**
- Defined a User Schema using Mongoose to store user details (name, email, password, etc.).
- Implemented necessary validations to ensure data integrity.
- Integrated bcrypt for secure password hashing.

âœ… **User Controller Setup**
- Developed controller functions to:
  - Create new users.
  - Retrieve user details.
  - Update user information.
  - Delete users if necessary.
- Handled error responses for invalid or duplicate user entries.

âœ… **Multer File Upload Integration**
- Configured Multer to handle file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).
- Implemented logic to store and retrieve uploaded images.
- Ensured file validation to prevent invalid file types from being uploaded.

âœ… **Project Submission**
- Pushed the updated code to GitHub.
- Updated the README with Milestone 4 details.

ðŸ“Œ *This milestone strengthened the user management aspect of our application, making it more robust and scalable for future enhancements.*

### **Milestone 6: Backend Signup Endpoint and Password Encryption** ðŸš€

âœ… **Signup Endpoint Implementation**
- Created a new route and controller function to handle POST requests to the signup endpoint.
- Received user data from the frontend signup form.

âœ… **Password Encryption**
- Used bcrypt to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
- Ensured that passwords are never stored in plain text.

âœ… **User Data Storage**
- Stored the complete user data (name, email, hashed password, etc.) in the MongoDB database.
- Implemented error handling for duplicate entries and other potential issues.

âœ… **README Update**
- Documented Milestone 6 progress in the README file.

ðŸ“Œ *This milestone focused on securely handling user registration on the backend, including the crucial step of password encryption. This is essential for protecting user data and maintaining security best practices.*

# Milestone 7 - Login Endpoint

## Overview
This milestone involves creating a login endpoint that allows users to authenticate using their email/username and password.

## Steps

### 1. Create Login Endpoint
- Accept user credentials (email/username and password).
- Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.

### 2. Validate Password
- Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
- Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js / Express (or relevant backend framework)
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoint
### Login
**POST** `/api/login`
#### Request Body
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```
#### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "your-jwt-token"
}
```
